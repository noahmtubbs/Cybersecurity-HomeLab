# Cybersecurity-HomeLab
This is a repository for documentation for my personal cybersecurity lab using Hyper-V, Kali Linux, and Metasploitable. Focuses on vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques.
- Using VSFTPD 234 Backdoor to crack user's password
- Using remote command injection vulnerability in Samba to create a POC File in /root
- Exploiting the UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 Backdoor (CVE-2010-2075) to gain root access and establish persistence.
